# MotorcycleGPS_Blynk
Uses an ESP32 and a SIM7000 along with an ADXL345 to give live GPS updates over the Blynk App

This project was originally done using a LilyGo T-SIM7000G ESP32-WROVER-B board and a Hologram SIM card. 

I used this to track my motorcycle if it were to ever be stolen. It uses an ADXL 345 accelerometer to check if the bike has had any movement. It then sends a notification to the Blynk app and give real time tracking. Sensitivity can be alterered to tigger the alarm as well as how frequent data is sent to keep cost/use of SIM card down. I want to thank the GreatScott! youtube chanel for the inspiration as well as Botletics SIM7000 board as that is where I played with the fundamentals of the SIM7000. A voltage stepdown converter will be needed to wire to a power supply.
